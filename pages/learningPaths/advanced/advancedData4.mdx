# Branch merge y append!!

**Step By Setp Guide: Merge & Append**

Both Steps are used for combine datasets: With the Append Step, you will combine vertically both datasets. On the other hand, Merge allows you to combine datasets side by side by matching entity values on both datasets.

**01.**	*Clipping Datasets*

Go to the repository Sales Dataset Example. Then, clipped the three datasets to use them later:

**02** *Create a Pipeline*

As we have seen, go to the right corner of your screen Create New then click on Pipeline

We will begin by loading Jane's sales data. Let's select **Fetch Alphacast Dataset** and drag and drop our clipped dataset **SalesData** from the sidebar.

***03**	*Append Step*

We have a number of options here. First, we need to choose which data we are going to append  Jhon Doe information to our data. We have two options:

3.1 *Load a dataset*

![append 1 o 2.png](https://alphacast-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/next-s3-uploads/90fcb38e-0ae2-4f27-b9f0-dc2bd4e4d42e/append-1-o-2.png)

3.2 *Fetch a dataset*

We have the option of transforming it before appending it.  If you like, you can add more steps to be executed between the fetching of the data and the append step.

![append 1 o 2.png](https://alphacast-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/next-s3-uploads/f29154da-ab31-4875-a2a0-61492a5edbc3/append-1-o-2.png)

![append 2p.png](https://alphacast-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/next-s3-uploads/ce035420-ec1a-41b0-98e2-642d4d0b6aa5/append-2p.png)

**04**	*Append Editor*

We need to define how will the "duplicates" be handled. What will happen if there are rows in both datasets that share the same entities? You have to decide whether you will keep the data from the original dataset, from the new one, or drop both.

Notice that we now have John and Jane on a single dataset.

**05.**	*Merge Step*

Now we are going to combine this data with the third dataset, with information on the number of items sold by both of them.Again, we need to choose the dataset. This time we will drag and drop "Items Sold".

**06.**	*Merge Editor*

6.1 *Criteria to combine the rows*

How can we know which rows from the first dataset correspond to each row from the second one.

Year and Sales Person are the two entities of our data. In this example, we just need to define that year match with year, and that sales persons match with sales person.

6.2 *Find a match between both datasets*

We have to decide what will happen when not all rows and columns in both datasets find a match in the other one.
There are four options here.

•	First, keep all the rows from the first dataset, even if they don't match a row in the second one.

•	Second, the same criteria but keeping rows from the second dataset.

•	Third, keep all the rows from both datasets, even if they don't match.

•	Finally, keep only those rows that match.

In this example, all the rows match, so the result will look alike with any option.
