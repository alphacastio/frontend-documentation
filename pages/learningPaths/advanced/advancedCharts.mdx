Condicion: haber agregado una anotacion, activado algun control


Step-by-Step Guide:

To begin, click on the Clone button of a chart in the pipeline to clone it to your repository.

Edit the first chart by accessing the "Customize" tab.

Define the minimum and maximum values of the "why" axis or leave it empty for automatic changes.

Change the label of the X axis and format the dates.

Change the look and feel of the borders of the charting area with Axis Appearance.

Choose the starting and ending timeline and default timeframe shown with Timeline Selection.

Hide markers and make thicker lines with Lines Appearance.

Define the default color palette for data with Color Schemes.

Customize legends by hiding, moving, or switching them to floating legends.

Click to unhide controls such as the relative toggle, running sum, and year comparison to see how they can be used in the chart.

Add annotations such as lines and text to your charts that move with the timeline.

Split a chart into two or more vertical charts by creating a new layer in the chart with its own "why" axis.

Both charts will update together when moving the timeline.

Hi! Welcome to the first part of the advanced level Learning Path. Congratulations on reaching this far! In this video, we will learn more advanced techniques for editing charts.

Let's begin by cloning a chart. Notice how every chart has a Clone button. After clicking it, the pipeline that creates that chart will be cloned to your repository. 

This is the Brazilian exports and import data that we used on the intermediate level, and there are two charts on this pipeline.  Let's edit the first one.

We’ve already learned how to change texts and add and remove data. Let’s learn some new things. There are many options on the “Customize” tab.

Here you can define the minimum and maximum values of the "why" axis. If you leave this empty, the axis will automatically change every time the timeline changes.

Down here, you can change the label of the X axis, and the format of the dates.

With Axis Appearance you can change the look and feel of the borders of the charting area

With Timeline selection, you can choose when your chart begins and end, and what will be de default timeframe shown

With Lines Appearance you can hide the markers and make thicker lines

With Color schemes, you can define the default color palette for the data in your chart.  Corporate users can create Brand Themes, and add watermark logos to the charts. Everything you create in a repository with a theme will look alike.

In "legends" you can hide the legend box, move it and switch it to floating legends. 

We have finally reached the controls. Let's explore them in depth because they are very useful.

When you click to unhide any control, it will appear at the bottom left of your chart. Let's unhide the relative toggle, the running sum, and the year comparison.  The Stacked toggle, on the other hand, is used in bar charts.

The relative change control with switch the values in the chart from their absolute values to their relative change versus the first value. If you move the timeline it will be updated in real time.

The running sum control calculates the sum and also be updated when you move the timeline.

The year comparison control keeps your first series and splits it year by year. Notice how the x axis is now showing month. You can use this to see compare the data for the same month in different years. - - - 

Another very useful feature is annotations.  You can add lines, text, and more to your charts. The annotations will then move with the timeline. - - 

To finish this video, I will teach show you to split a chart into two or more vertical charts. Let's see an example with the second chart in this pipeline.

Here we have the monthly values of exports and imports, and also the 12 monthly running sums that we calculated at the intermediate level.

If you click here, you can create a new layer in the chart, with its own "why" axis. - - Both charts will update together when moving the timeline.

In the next video, we will start learning more advanced data transformations. See you there!
