**Step by Step Guide: How to Calculate Variables**

Welcome to the advanced level learning path! Begin exploring advanced data processing features. So, let's get started! 

We will show you how to create new variables using the **"Calculate Variable"** pipeline step. 

**01.** Fetch Dataset: *In the example, we used the equity data from Yahoo Finance (AAPL, MSFT, GOOG)*

**02.** Add the **Select Columns** step in the Filters category: *select the columns to be used, such as “Close.”*

**02.** Add the **Calculate Variable** step in the Transforms category 

**03.** Choose a **name** for the new column. Then, to add formulas, simply type the name of the column you want to work with, using the format **@column**. From there, you can begin adding formulas by **opening a parenthesis** and selecting the desired function or operator.

- Use an asterisk and two to multiply.

- Use nested formulas to replace close with the square of close.

- Use Group Functions to split the dataset into groups defined by the entity values and make calculations within those groups.

- Use Rolling Window functions to make calculations within a group and also within a rolling window.

Once you have finished, click on the 'Save and preview' button to save your work and see the result of your calculations. Alternatively, you can add a new step to create a chart and visualize your data.

In the next video, we will explore additional advanced data transformation techniques that you can use to take your analysis to the next level!
