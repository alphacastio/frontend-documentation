**Step By Step Guide**

You can create a pipeline by clicking on **Create Pipeline** at the top right corner. Select a name and a repository for your pipeline, then choose one of three options to fetch data from: *Alphacast Dataset, FRED Saint Louis, and Yahoo Finance*, which are two very popular data repositories. We have provided quick integration for both of them.

Once you have created the pipeline, you can change the frequency of the data by adding the change frequency step and selecting a formula for monthly data. By adding the **Change Frequency** step, you can take your daily data and convert it to either monthly, quarterly, or yearly data.

Alternatively, to remove the effect of inflation on prices, you can change the unit by adding the **Change Unit** step and selecting the United States and the variable *Close*. The step will recognize the frequency of your dataset, and the available options will depend on it. The usual options include changing the unit to constant prices, percentage of GDP, dollars, or per capita.
