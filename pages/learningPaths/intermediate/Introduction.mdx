Hi! Welcome to the Intermediate Level Learning Path. 

We will deep dive into one of the most powerful features of Alphacast: Pipelines. With pipelines, you can transform the data every time it is updated and have it ready to use. We will cover basic data transformations and reshapes, including filtering and renamings, changes in time frequency and interpolations, seasonal adjustment, changing currencies, and more.

This course will take you about 30 minutes. Letâ€™s dive in.
