**Step by Step Guide: How to Transform Data with Pipelines**

This video will teach you about pipelines and how they can process data in Alphacast without requiring any coding

Pipelines are the most powerful feature of the platform, allowing you to process data within it. They consist of a sequence of steps that transform data in a variety of ways.

You can choose different ways to start creating a pipeline:

- The long road involves click on **Create new Pipeline** in the top right corner of the screen, then choose the repository and the desired pipeline name, finally click on the 'create' button.

- The quick way to do it is by clicking on **Transform** directly in the dataset view.

**01.** Fetch [Alphacast](https://www.alphacast.io/datasets/external-sector-brazil-secex-external-trade-9195) Dataset:

**02.** Add the **Select Columns** step in the filters category: *in this case, exports and imports*

**03.** Add the **Rename Columns** step in the reshaping category and pick a new name for the variables

**04.** Add the **Apply Transform** step and select **sum last 12 months** on the drop-down menu and which variable you want to transform.

**05.** Add the step **Publish to dataset** and choose a name. The dataset will be created in the same repository as the pipeline.

**06.** If you do not wish to publish the datasets, you can create a **Data Snapshot** which takes a snapshot of the data up to that step and provides you access to it through a link.

In the next video, you will learn how to change the frequency, perform data interpolation, and modify the units.
