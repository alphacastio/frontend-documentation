Congratulations, you have completed the beginner level Learning Path!

In this section, you will learn how to create a basic chart with the data you just uploaded.

To create a chart from scratch, click "create new" and "chart" in the upper right corner. This will redirect you to the pipelines editor.

Alternatively, you can select the variables you want by clicking on "Create chart" from any dataset. This will redirect you to the chart editor where you can customize it.

In the pipelines editor, you can see the two steps involved in creating a chart: fetching the data from the dataset and charting it. You can transform, combine, and reshape the data before charting it in the intermediate level Learning Path.

On the Data Tab, choose the data that will be shown on the chart. Variables are split to display values for each entity independently.

You can customize whether the series is a line, a bar, or an area and change the axis.

You can also decide whether the viewer can change what is on the charts. For example, you can let the user choose what entity is being shown and switch interactively 
between entities directly in the chart.

In the Text Tab, change the titles, subtitles, fonts, alignments, etc.

If you click "save", your charts will be published in your home and ready to use.

There are dozens of chart alternatives. Explore our chart gallery in the learning center to get some fresh ideas.

Congratulations! You now know how to discover data and create basic charts, dashboards, and datasets.

To learn more advanced features, including integrations and how to transform data with pipelines, advance to the intermediate level Learning Path.

Good Job!! This is the last section of the beginner level Learning Path. We will now learn how to create a basic chart with the data you just uploaded.

You can create charts from scratch by clicking “create new” and “chart” in the upper right corner. You will be redirected to the pipelines editor.

However, in this video, we'll use a shortcut.

From any dataset, you can select the variables you want by just clicking on Create chart. It will redirect you to the chart editor where you can customize it.

You are now on the pipelines editor. See on the left how this pipeline has two steps. The first one is to fetch the data from the dataset and the second one is to chart it. You can transform, combine and reshape the data before charting it, but we will see more about that on the intermediate level Learning Path.

Let's review some basic customization.

You can change whether the series is a line, a bar o an area and also change the axis.

On the Data Tab, you can choose what data will be shown on the chart. Notice how the variables are split to display values for each entity independently.

You can also decide whether the viewer can change what is on the charts. For example, you can let the user choose what entity is being shown. Also, you can switch interactively between entities directly in the chart.

In the Text Tab, you can change the titles, subtitles, fonts, alignments, etc.

We will leave the Customize and Annotations tabs for the intermediate course

If you click "save", your charts will be published in your home and ready to use.

There are dozens of chart alternatives. You can explore our chart gallery in the learning center to get some fresh ideas.

Congratulations! You have completed the Beginner Level Learning Path. You know how to discover data, and how to create basic charts, dashboards, and datasets.

Advance to the intermediate level Learning path to discover more advanced features including integrations and how to transform data with the pipelines.
