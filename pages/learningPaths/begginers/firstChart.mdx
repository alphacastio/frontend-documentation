To create a chart you have two options: 

•	From scratch, click "create new" and "chart" in the upper right corner. This will redirect you to the pipelines editor.

•	You can select the variables you want by clicking on "Create chart" from any dataset. This will redirect you to the chart editor where you can customize it.
Once you see the pipelines editor, you can see the two steps: fetching the data from the dataset and charting it. Also, you can transform, combine, and reshape the data before charting it, click here for more information!

• In the Basic Tab, you have the ability to customize each variable by adding a secondary axis, editing the unit of measurement for each one, and converting units of measurement using the Unit factor conversion.

• Moving on to the Data Tab, you can customize the series by choosing to display it as a line, bar, or area and change the axis accordingly. Additionally, you can decide whether or not the viewer can make changes to the chart.

•	Text Tab, change the titles, subtitles, fonts, alignments, etc.

• In the Customize Tab, you can determine the minimum and maximum values of the left axis, select the desired series with the Time selection section, and choose the X axis Label and date format. Additionally, you can choose to hide the legend or give it a specific format. The controls include the Relative Tonge Running Sum Control.

• Into the Annotations Tab, you can add lines, texts and much more.
