# Introduction
 
Hello and welcome to our beginner-level course! In this course, we will be covering the basics of finding and working with data on Alphacast.

In our first video, we will learn how to navigate the platform, explore datasets, and use filters to find the data we need. We will also cover how to download datasets and create charts from them.

Our second video will focus on creating dashboards, combining charts and text to get a quick view of the data. We will learn how to clip charts, add them to the dashboard canvas, and publish our dashboard to a repository.

In the third video, we will learn how to bring our own data to Alphacast. We will cover how to upload data manually from a CSV or excel file and how to connect data from Google Drive.

Video 4 is the final section of the Beginner Level Learning Path, which teaches how to create a basic chart. It covers basic customization options such as changing the chart type and axis, choosing data to display, and customizing text, and advanced charting features such as color schemes, controls, annotations, or how to split a chart into multiple vertical charts.

Remember, this is only the beginner-level course, and Alphacast offers intermediate and advanced level courses as well. So let's get started and dive into the world of data on Alphacast!
