Hi! Welcome to the first video of our beginner learning path. We will learn the basics of finding and dealing with data. Alphacast hosts thousands of datasets from more than two hundred sources, that cover major economic and financial topics.

Let's head to the "Explore" section! You'll notice that the data is organized into categories. You'll find data on markets, production, inflation, and much more.

You will also find popular datasets and recommendations based on people similar to you.

Filters will help you narrow your search. Datasets are classified by country, frequency, sources, time span, and other special collections. The collection “Macro Basics”, for instance, curates a small set of datasets with the most common variables of each country.

Of course, you can also use the search bar.  Let's search, for example, the Gross Domestic Product of Latin America. Notice how the results show information not only on datasets but also results on repositories, charts, and insights. We will see more about this later.

Once you’ve found the dataset you're looking for, you'll reach the datasets view. Let’s have a quick look at what we have here. 

You can see some basic information such as the description, source, tags, or timespan, and also the repository where this dataset is and when was it last updated. - In some cases, you will notice that the dataset was created through a pipeline. We will cover pipelines on the intermediate learning path, but by clicking here you can trace how this dataset was created by combining and transforming other data sources.

In the "versions" tab, you can see the changelog of this dataset, to understand how it has changed over time. The data is usually updated once a day, but- the Sync Now button will go fetch the data from the source and update it. This is useful, for example, if you are working with intraday data, or want to update a dataset that is connected to Google Drive.

Creating charts from these datasets is also very easy.  Just click “create chart” and you will be prompted to the pipelines interface, where you can edit your chart. We will come back to pipelines and the charts editor later in the course.

To finish this first video, Let me show you how to download the data. You can apply filters before downloading, and then it is simply clicking on download and choosing the format 

That was it. see you in the next video
