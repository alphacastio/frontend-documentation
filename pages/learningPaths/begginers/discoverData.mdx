Hi! In this first tutorial We will learn the basics of finding and dealing with data. Alphacast hosts thousands of datasets from more than two hundred sources, that cover major economic and financial topics.


- Go to the "Explore" section.. You'll notice that the data is organized into categories: markets, production, inflation, and much more. You will also find popular datasets and recommendations based on people similar to you.

- Use filters to narrow your search. Datasets are classified by country, frequency, sources, time span, and other special collections. The collection “Macro Basics”, for instance, curates a small set of datasets with the most common variables of each country.
