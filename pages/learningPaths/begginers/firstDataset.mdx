**How to Bring Your Own Data to Alphacast**

First, click on *"Create new dataset"* in the top right corner of the screen.

*Note that datasets in Alphacast require each variable to be in a separate column and that there must be a column with dates or timestamps to upload and visualize the data in charts.*

Prepare your data avoiding empty rows and making sure column names are not repeated.

**01.** Select the *file* you want to upload. You can select an Excel (xls or xlsx) or CSV file from your computer or Google Drive.

**02.** Configuring your dataset and determining if entities are needed:

 - It is important to identify which columns will be used as entities and which columns can be ignored because are necessary to uniquely define a row of the dataset. Click each column and select to handle it as an entity or ignore the column. 
 - and then you can define the type of each variable as text or number and only indicate the date format for date column.

**03.** Click "Next" and choose the name of the dataset and save it in the desired repository

Wait a couple of seconds for the data to upload and become ready to use!
