Hi! In this video, you will learn how to create your first dashboard. Dashboards let you combine charts and text, and see the data always up to date on a single glimpse.  You can use your own charts or those created by other users.

Dashboards are very easy to create. The first step is ”Clipping charts”. Every chart you find on Alphacast will have a clip button. Once clipped, these charts will be found by clicking on the clip at the top right of your screen.

Now to create the dashboard let’s click on “Create New Insight” and then “Switch to Dashboard View”.

Adding new charts is as simple as dragging and dropping them on the canvas. You can then resize and replace them at will, and also edit the timeline. 

You can add as many as you like, either your charts or those created by other users of the community.

To place text, just drag and drop a textbox and add Markdown text. If you want to learn more about the markdown text option please refer to the resources section.

The last step is to publish your dashboard. In order to do so, click the publish button and select in which repository you want to place it.

And that’s it! You have just created and published your first dashboard.
