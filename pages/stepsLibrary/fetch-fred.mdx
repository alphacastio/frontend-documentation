# Fetch FRED

If you work with economic data you probably know [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/), the massive database created by the US Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis, that claims to have 816,000 US and international time series from 108 sources.

Creating a dataset or pipeline by importing from Yahoo finance is as simple as

1. Click on **Create new pipeline** in the top right corner of the screen. Then choose the repository and the desired pipeline name, finally click on the **Create** button.
2. Select **Fetch Fred Data** step

3. To load data into Alphacast you need to know the series Code. Each series has a unique code that can be found in two places on FRED site. On the URL and next to its name. 

**In the following example the series code is T10Y2Y and MORTGAGE30US**

Include as many series as you like, separating them by a comma. See a working example [here](https://www.alphacast.io/pipelines/2022-6-10-xaJGgt/view)

Ready! You can now publish the dataset, chart the data, process it or any other cool option available in pipelines.
